Hello!

My name is Alberto, I am currently self teaching python with the help of CS50p and freecodecamp. 

I hope to become a software engineer in the furture after learing more languages and building fun projects with others!

Any help with my code would be nothing but helpful so, feedback is always appreciated! 

 Thank you for taking the time to check out my profile. Hope you have a great day! :)
